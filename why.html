        Why I prefer Dogs over Cats
     </h2>  
     <p>
     I prefer Dogs over Cats in my opinion because Dogs are way more energetic and they could do anything. Dogs have taken the world in awe because of how cute they are, from Boston Terriar, to Huskys, Chihuahua, and the list goes on and on! Dogs will chase after any toy you throw, cats on the other hand will just give you a mean look and walk away. Dogs are just something you need when you are feeling down, my dogs brighten up my day completely. Dogs are less stealthy than cats which would make you think,"What's wrong with that?" you may think your cat is lost, roaming your house "Where are you cat?" and they just pop out, Dogs will never leave your sight. They also make you feel like if your the President of America(They will never stop following you and giving you licks).</p>
